# Homotopies-from-L-to-M
 Homotopies and Maps between Eigenvalues of some Generalized Lucas Sequences and the Mandelbrot set:

 The eigenvalues of companion matrices associated with generalized Lucas sequences, denoted as $\mathcal{L}$, exhibit a striking geometric resemblance to the Mandelbrot set $\mathcal{M}$. This work investigates this connection by analyzing the statistical distribution of eigenvalues and exploring different types of piecewise homotopies that map different regions of $\mathcal{L}$ to structurally corresponding subsets of $\mathcal{M}$, including one that uses the Jungreis map. We also classify eigenvalues based on their dynamical properties, identifying subsets associated with hyperbolic, Misurewicz, parabolic, and Siegel disk points.
